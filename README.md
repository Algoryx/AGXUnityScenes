# AGXUnityScenes
This project contains sample scenes using AGXUnity and AGX Dynamics in Unity3D.
Please go ahead and use them as you like. 

## Installing
To use these scenes you need to do the following:

1. Create a new empty project
2. In the project-directory `Assets` clone/unzip the [AGXUnity project](https://github.com/Algoryx/AGXUnity). Now you should have `<your-project>\Assets\AGXUnity`
3. Install AGX Dynamics from [Algoryx Simulation](https://www.algoryx.se/products/agx-dynamics/) on your computer. 
4. Copy the AGXDotNet.dll file from the AGX Dynamics installation directory (`<agx-dir>\bin\x64`) into `<your-project>\Assets\AGXDotNet\plugins\x64_86`
5. Next, clone/unzip this (AGXUnityScenes) project into the `Assets` directory. Now you should also have the following structure: `<your-project>\Assets\AGXUnityScenes`
6. When all scripts are compiled, locate the sample scenes in the `Assets\AGXUnityScenes\` sub-directory and drag them from the Project to the Hiearchy.
7. Done.
